# Computation Complexity

## Undeciable
Halting problem
It cannot be solved

## Decidable (R: recursive)

It would terminate at some time

## Exponential

2^(N^C)


## NP Non deterministic polynomial

Can write a veifier/proof that take solution and input of problem and tell
if it is True and it runs in polynomial time.

What about problem input, solution polynomial in size.


## Polynomial

T(n) = O(N^C)

If we increase constant size, the increase is linear increase.

T(2N) = 2^C*N^C  => 2^C is a constant
